# Tapor-Coding-Tools
Welcome to the Tapor Coding Tools github. The project is led by Geoffrey Rockwell, Stéfan Sinclair, and Milena Radzikowska and housed at the University of Alberta. Support for this project came from Compute Canada Calcul: Westgrid the Canadian Institute for Research Computing in the Arts, University of Alberta, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
 
This gituhb is directly assoicated with TAPoR (http://tapor.ca/home)

With TAPoR 3.0 you can:

    Discover text manipulation, analysis, and visualization tools
    Discover historic tools
    Read tool reviews and recommendations
    Learn about papers, articles and other sources about specific tools
    Tag, comment, rate, and review collaboratively
    Browse lists of related tools in order to discover tools more easily

The TAPoR 3.0 redesign aimed to:

    Improve tool discovery interface
    Improve engagement with text analysis tools
    Focus on the discovery and social use of text analysis tools
    Better communicate information about text analysis tools
    Provide an Application Programming Interface to other services
    Gather and reflect data about tool usage use

TAPoR Redesign
We have recently redesigned TAPoR in order to integrate the DiRT (Digital Research Tools) Directory. The integration was managed by Kaitlyn Grant with help from Quinn Dombrowski and programming by Omar Rodriquez-Arenas. 
 
TaDiRAH Taxonomy

With the integration of DiRT Directory, TAPoR has made use of the TaDiRAH Goals & Methods tags, to better cateogrize the tools.
