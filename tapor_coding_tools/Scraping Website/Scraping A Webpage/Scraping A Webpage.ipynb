Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).\n",

However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. A web scraper is an Application Programming Interface (API) to extract data from a web site. Companies like Amazon AWS and Google provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users.\n",

      "There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in  DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.\n",

It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.\n",

Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n",

It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be  US Copyright law , and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection.

      "<p> Web scraping ,  web harvesting , or  web data extraction  is  data scraping  used for  extracting data  from  websites .<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Boeing2016JPER_1-0\"> [1] </sup> Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the  Hypertext Transfer Protocol , or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a  bot  or  web crawler . It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local  database  or spreadsheet, for later  retrieval  or  analysis .\n",
      "</p><p>Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Boeing2016JPER_1-1\"> [1] </sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"> [2] </sup> Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be  parsed , searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).\n",
      "</p><p>Web scraping is used for  contact scraping , and as a component of applications used for  web indexing ,  web mining  and  data mining , online price change monitoring and  price comparison , product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring,  website change detection , research, tracking online presence and reputation,  web mashup  and, web data integration.\n",
      "</p><p> Web pages  are built using text-based mark-up languages ( HTML  and  XHTML ), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form.  However, most web pages are designed for human  end-users  and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. A web scraper is an  Application Programming Interface  (API) to extract data from a web site. Companies like  Amazon AWS  and  Google  provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users.\n",
      "</p><p>Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers.  For example,  JSON  is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.\n",
      "</p><p>There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in   DOM  parsing,  computer vision  and  natural language processing  to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.\n",
      "</p><p>Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the  semantic web  vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and  human-computer interactions . Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.\n",
      "</p><p>Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human’s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\n",
      "</p><p>A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX  grep  command or  regular expression -matching facilities of programming languages (for instance  Perl  or  Python ).\n",
      "</p><p> Static  and  dynamic web pages  can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using  socket programming .\n",
      "</p><p>Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a  wrapper . Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"> [3] </sup> Moreover, some  semi-structured data  query languages, such as  XQuery  and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n",
      "</p><p>By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the  Internet Explorer  or the  Mozilla  browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages.\n",
      "</p><p>There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of “bots” for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the  Long Tail  of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\n",
      "</p><p>The pages being scraped may embrace  metadata  or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as  Microformat  does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"> [4] </sup> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n",
      "</p><p>There are efforts using  machine learning  and  computer vision  that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"> [5] </sup>\n",
      "</p><p>There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.\n",
