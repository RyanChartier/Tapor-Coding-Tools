    "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is just one part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). At its most basic level, the main idea behind sentiment analysis is to categorize a section of text (words, sentences, tweets, etc) either as \"postive\" or \"negative\". However sentiment analysis is not only limited to just \"postive\" and \"negative\", it could also categorized by different emotions. There are many different ways to conduct sentiment analysis, in this notebook we showcase a few ways to do so ranging from very basic to more advance methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note here we are going to avoid just matching words to calculate sentiment. That is to say, we are not going to have a dictionary of words of a category (e.x 'postive') and seeing if the input text contains those words. This is a relative simple method to calculate sentiment anaylsis. Therefore we are going to mainly focus on predicting the sentiment of a input text.\n",

    "In this notebook we will showcase a few way to do so.\n",
